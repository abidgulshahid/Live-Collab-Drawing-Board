Example Pipeline:

name: Deploy to AWS EC2

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          cd server && npm install
          cd ../client && npm install

      - name: Build Frontend
        run: |
          cd client
          npm run build

      - name: Deploy to EC2
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        run: |
          # SSH into EC2 and deploy
          ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip> << 'EOF'
          cd /path/to/project
          git pull origin main
          pm2 restart all
